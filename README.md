## Results 📊
TalentBridge is a comprehensive platform with both a website and a mobile app that offers the following functionalities:

### For Juniors:
1. **Skill-Based Project Matching**:
   - Juniors can input their skills and interests into their profiles, from experiences to certificates, languages, and skills. They can also receive reviews on their profile after completing projects. 📝
   - Each skill is assigned a **rating** (e.g., beginner, intermediate, advanced), which determines the level of projects they are matched with. 📊
   - Projects are displayed based on the junior's skill level and interests, ensuring a tailored experience. 🎯

2. **Project Application**:
   - Juniors can browse projects by field, duration, price, project name, or senior name. 🔍
   - Applications are submitted easily, and approval is given by the senior, either automatically or manually after reviewing applications. 📝

3. **Project Workspace**:
   - Once accepted into a project, juniors gain access to a dedicated workspace with task descriptions, deadlines, and a group chat for collaboration. Deliverables for each task are submitted, and juniors wait for review and feedback from the senior. 📋
   - Seniors provide feedback on completed tasks, helping juniors improve their skills. 📝

### For Seniors:

   - After each delivery from a junior, a mark is placed on the task, along with feedback or notes. This leads to a review of the junior’s skills, which updates the junior’s level on their profile after completing each project. 📈
